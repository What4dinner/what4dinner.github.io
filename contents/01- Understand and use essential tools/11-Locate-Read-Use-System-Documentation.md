# Locate, Read, and Use System Documentation

## Introduction

Effective use of system documentation is a critical skill for RHCSA certification. Red Hat emphasizes the ability to find and use documentation during the exam, as you won't have internet access. This guide covers the three primary documentation sources: `man` pages, `info` pages, and files in `/usr/share/doc`.

---

## Manual Pages (man)

The `man` command provides access to the system reference manuals. It is the primary documentation source for Linux commands, system calls, configuration files, and more.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
man [SECTION] COMMAND
```

### Man Page Sections

Understanding sections is crucial for the RHCSA exam:

| Section | Content Type | Examples |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | User commands (executable programs) | `ls`, `cp`, `grep` |
| 2 | System calls (kernel functions) | `open`, `read`, `write` |
| 3 | Library functions (C library) | `printf`, `malloc` |
| 4 | Special files (devices) | `/dev/null`, `/dev/sda` |
| 5 | File formats and conventions | `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/fstab` |
| 6 | Games | - |
| 7 | Miscellaneous (conventions, protocols) | `ascii`, `utf-8` |
| 8 | System administration commands | `mount`, `useradd`, `systemctl` |
| 9 | Kernel routines (non-standard) | - |

### Common Man Command Usage

```bash
# View man page for a command
man ls

# View man page from specific section
man 5 passwd

# View man page with section specified differently
man passwd.5

# View all man pages for a topic
man -a passwd

# Show location of man page file
man -w passwd

# Display all matching man pages sequentially
man -a intro
```

---

## Navigating Man Pages

Man pages are displayed using the `less` pager. Master these navigation keys:

### Navigation Keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` or `Page Down` | Move forward one page |
| `b` or `Page Up` | Move backward one page |
| `Enter` or `Down Arrow` | Move forward one line |
| `k` or `Up Arrow` | Move backward one line |
| `g` | Go to beginning of document |
| `G` | Go to end of document |
| `/pattern` | Search forward for pattern |
| `?pattern` | Search backward for pattern |
| `n` | Repeat search in same direction |
| `N` | Repeat search in opposite direction |
| `q` | Quit |
| `h` | Display help |

---

## Man Page Structure

Every man page follows a standard structure:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **NAME** | Command name and brief description |
| **SYNOPSIS** | Command syntax and usage format |
| **DESCRIPTION** | Detailed description of the command |
| **OPTIONS** | Available command-line options |
| **EXAMPLES** | Usage examples (if provided) |
| **FILES** | Related configuration files |
| **SEE ALSO** | Related commands and man pages |
| **EXIT STATUS** | Return codes and their meanings |
| **AUTHOR** | Who wrote the command/documentation |
| **BUGS** | Known issues |

### Reading the SYNOPSIS

The SYNOPSIS section uses conventions:

| Format | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **bold text** | Type exactly as shown |
| *italic text* or underlined | Replace with appropriate argument |
| `[-abc]` | Options in brackets are optional |
| `-a\|-b` | Options separated by `\|` are mutually exclusive |
| `argument...` | Argument can be repeated |
| `[expression]...` | Entire expression can be repeated |

---

## Searching for Man Pages

### The `apropos` Command

Search man page names and descriptions for keywords:

```bash
# Search for pages related to "password"
apropos password

# Search for pages related to "partition"
apropos partition

# Search with exact match
apropos -e passwd

# Search using wildcard
apropos -w 'user*'

# Search using regular expression
apropos -r 'copy.*file'

# Limit search to specific section
apropos -s 5 passwd
```

### The `man -k` Command

Equivalent to `apropos`:

```bash
# Same as apropos password
man -k password

# Search for network-related commands
man -k network

# Search for commands related to "disk"
man -k disk
```

### The `whatis` Command

Display one-line descriptions of man pages:

```bash
# Show description of passwd command
whatis passwd

# Show descriptions for multiple commands
whatis ls cp mv

# Use wildcard
whatis -w 'ls*'
```

### The `man -f` Command

Equivalent to `whatis`:

```bash
# Same as whatis passwd
man -f passwd

# Show which sections have pages for passwd
man -f passwd
# Output:
# passwd (1)    - update user's authentication tokens
# passwd (5)    - password file
```

---

## Updating the Man Database

The search commands (`apropos`, `whatis`, `man -k`) use a database. If recently installed packages don't appear in searches:

```bash
# Update the man page database (as root)
sudo mandb

# Force recreation of database
sudo mandb -c
```

---

## Info Pages

The GNU Info system provides more detailed, hyperlinked documentation for GNU software. Info pages are organized in a tree structure with nodes.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# View info page for a command
info ls

# View info page for coreutils
info coreutils

# Start at a specific node
info bash 'Basic Shell Features'
```

### Info Navigation Keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Scroll forward |
| `Backspace` or `Delete` | Scroll backward |
| `n` | Go to next node |
| `p` | Go to previous node |
| `u` | Go up to parent node |
| `l` | Go to last visited node |
| `t` | Go to top node |
| `Enter` | Follow hyperlink under cursor |
| `Tab` | Move to next hyperlink |
| `/pattern` | Search for pattern |
| `s` or `/` | Search forward |
| `q` | Quit |
| `h` | Display help |
| `?` | Display command summary |

### Info vs Man

| Feature | man | info |
|---------|-----|------|
| Format | Single page | Multiple linked nodes |
| Navigation | Linear scroll | Hyperlinked tree |
| Detail | Concise reference | Extended documentation |
| Primary use | Quick reference | In-depth learning |
| All commands | Yes | Mainly GNU tools |

---

## Using `pinfo` (if available)

`pinfo` is a more user-friendly info viewer with color support:

```bash
# View info page with pinfo
pinfo bash

# Navigation is similar to info but with better visual cues
```

---

## Documentation in /usr/share/doc

The `/usr/share/doc` directory contains additional documentation for installed packages, including:

- README files
- CHANGELOG files
- Configuration examples
- License information
- Sample configurations
- Tutorials and guides

### Exploring /usr/share/doc

```bash
# List all documentation directories
ls /usr/share/doc/

# View documentation for a specific package
ls /usr/share/doc/bash/

# Read the README file
less /usr/share/doc/bash/README

# Find specific documentation
ls /usr/share/doc/ | grep -i ssh

# View sample configuration files
ls /usr/share/doc/rsync*/
```

### Common Files in /usr/share/doc

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README` | General information about the package |
| `README.md` | Markdown format readme |
| `CHANGELOG` | Version history and changes |
| `NEWS` | Important changes between versions |

```

### Using dnf/yum for Documentation

```bash
# List files in a package (includes docs)
dnf repoquery -l bash

# Install documentation for a package
dnf install man-pages
```

---

## The --help Option

Most commands support `--help` for quick reference:

```bash
# View quick help for a command
ls --help

# Some commands use -h
grep -h

# Pipe to less for paging
systemctl --help | less
```

---

## Command-Specific Help

### Built-in Shell Commands

For shell built-ins, use `help`:

```bash
# Get help on shell built-ins
help cd
help alias
help export

# List all built-in commands
help

# View type of command (built-in, alias, or external)
type cd
type ls
```

## Key Points for RHCSA Exam

1. **Know man page sections**: Section 1 (commands), 5 (config files), 8 (admin commands)
2. **Use `man -k` or `apropos`**: Find commands when you don't remember the name
3. **Use `man -f` or `whatis`**: Quick one-line descriptions
4. **Specify section when needed**: `man 5 passwd` vs `man 1 passwd`
5. **Navigate efficiently**: `/pattern` to search, `n`/`N` to repeat
6. **Check /usr/share/doc**: For example configs and additional documentation
7. **Use `--help` for quick reference**: Faster than opening full man page
8. **Use `help` for built-ins**: `cd`, `alias`, `export` are shell built-ins
9. **Update database with `mandb`**: If new packages don't appear in searches
10. **Info pages for GNU tools**: More detailed than man pages for some tools
