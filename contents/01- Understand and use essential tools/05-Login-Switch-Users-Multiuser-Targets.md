# Log In and Switch Users in Multiuser Targets

## Topic Overview
This topic covers logging into Linux systems, switching between user accounts using `su` and `sudo`, and understanding systemd targets (multiuser, graphical, rescue, emergency). These are fundamental skills for system administration and are essential for the RHCSA exam.

> **Note:** For accessing systems remotely via SSH, see Topic 04: Access Remote Systems Using SSH.

## Understanding Systemd Targets

### What are Systemd Targets?
Systemd targets are units that group together other systemd units for synchronization purposes. They replace the traditional SysV runlevels and define the system state.

### Common Systemd Targets

| Target | Purpose | Equivalent Runlevel |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| `poweroff.target` | Shut down and power off the system | 0 |
| `rescue.target` | Single-user mode with basic system and mounts | 1 |
| `multi-user.target` | Multi-user, non-graphical (text mode) | 3 |
| `graphical.target` | Multi-user with graphical interface | 5 |
| `reboot.target` | Shut down and reboot the system | 6 |
| `emergency.target` | Emergency shell (minimal, read-only root) | - |

### Target Comparison

| Feature | multi-user.target | graphical.target | rescue.target | emergency.target |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Network | Yes | Yes | Limited | No |
| File systems | All mounted | All mounted | All mounted | Root only (may be read-only) |
| Services | Full | Full + GUI | Minimal | None |
| Users | Multiple | Multiple | Single (root) | Single (root) |
| Display Manager | No | Yes | No | No |

---

## Switching Between Users

### The `su` Command (Substitute User)

The `su` command allows you to switch to another user account.

**Syntax:**
```bash
su [options] [-] [user [argument...]]
```

### Key `su` Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-` or `-l` or `--login` | Start a login shell (full environment) |
| `-c command` | Execute a single command as the user |
| `-s shell` | Use specified shell instead of default |
| `-m` or `-p` | Preserve current environment |
| (no option) | Switch user without login shell (partial environment) |

### Difference Between `su` and `su -`

| Aspect | `su username` | `su - username` |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Working directory | Stays in current directory | Changes to user's home |
| Environment variables | Keeps most from current user | Loads target user's environment |
| PATH | Keeps current PATH | Loads target user's PATH |
| Shell initialization | Skips login scripts | Runs .bash_profile, .bashrc |

---

## The `sudo` Command

### What is sudo?
`sudo` (superuser do) allows a permitted user to execute commands as root or another user, as specified in the `/etc/sudoers` file.

**Syntax:**
```bash
sudo [options] command
```

### Key `sudo` Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-i` | Run login shell as root (simulate `su -`) |
| `-s` | Run shell as root (simulate `su`) |
| `-u user` | Run command as specified user |
| `-l` | List allowed (and forbidden) commands |
| `-k` | Reset cached credentials |
| `-v` | Update cached credentials without running command |
| `-b` | Run command in background |
| `-e` or `sudoedit` | Edit files (safe editing) |

### The wheel Group
In RHEL, members of the `wheel` group can use `sudo` to run commands as root. This is configured in `/etc/sudoers`.

---

## Configuring sudo with visudo

### The sudoers File
The `/etc/sudoers` file controls who can use sudo and what commands they can run.

**Always edit with:**
```bash
sudo visudo
```

### sudoers Syntax
```
user/group  hosts = (run_as_user) commands
```

### Common sudoers Entries

| Entry | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL` | wheel group members can run any command |
| `%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` | wheel group without password |
| `user1 ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/systemctl` | user1 can only run systemctl |
| `user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/yum` | user1 can run yum without password |
| `user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt, PASSWD: /bin/kill` | Mixed: apt without password, kill with password |
| `user1 ALL=ALL, !/usr/bin/su` | user1 can run all commands except su |

---

## User Account Types

Linux has different types of user accounts:

| Account Type | UID Range | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Root** | 0 | Superuser with unrestricted access |
| **System Accounts** | 1-999 | Created during OS installation for services (ssh, mail) |
| **Regular Users** | 1000+ | Normal user accounts for individuals |

### Viewing User Information

```bash
# Display current username
whoami

# Display user ID, group ID, and group memberships
id
id username

# View user account details
grep username /etc/passwd

# Display groups the current user belongs to
groups
groups username
```

### The `/etc/passwd` File Structure

Each line in `/etc/passwd` contains seven colon-separated fields:

```
username:x:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:shell
```

Example:
```bash
bob:x:1000:1000:Bob Smith:/home/bob:/bin/bash
```

---

## Monitoring User Sessions

### The `who` Command

Displays users currently logged in:

```bash
# Show logged in users
who

# Show additional details (idle time, PID)
who -a
```

### The `last` Command

Shows history of user logins and system reboots:

```bash
# Display login history
last

# Show last 10 logins
last -n 10

# Show reboot history
last reboot
```

---

## Disabling User Login

To prevent a user from logging in, set their shell to `/sbin/nologin`:

```bash
# Disable login for a user
sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin username

# Verify the change
grep username /etc/passwd

# Re-enable login
sudo usermod -s /bin/bash username
```

## Real-World Exam Practice Questions

### Question 1: Switch to Root User with Login Shell
**Task:** Switch to the root user with a full login environment.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```bash
# Method 1: Using su with login option
su -

# Method 2: Explicit root user
su - root

# Enter root password when prompted

# Verify you are root
whoami
id
pwd    # Should be /root
```

**Note:** The `-` ensures you get root's full environment including PATH.
</details>

---

### Question 2: Switch to Another User Without Login Shell
**Task:** Switch to user `developer` without starting a login shell (keeping your current environment).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```bash
# Switch without login shell
su developer

# Enter developer's password when prompted

# Note: Your working directory stays the same
pwd

# Your PATH may still contain your original paths
echo $PATH
```
</details>

---

### Question 3: Execute Single Command as Another User
**Task:** Run the command `cat /home/admin/notes.txt` as user `admin` without fully switching to that account.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```bash
# Using su -c to run a single command
su - admin -c "cat /home/admin/notes.txt"

# Enter admin's password when prompted
# After command executes, you return to your original shell
```
</details>

---

### Question 4: Run Command as Root Using sudo
**Task:** Install the `httpd` package using sudo without switching to root.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```bash
# Run yum as root using sudo
sudo yum install httpd -y

# Enter YOUR password (not root's) when prompted
```
</details>

---

### Question 5: Get a Root Shell Using sudo
**Task:** Open a root shell using sudo with the full login environment.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```bash
# Method 1: Login shell as root (recommended)
sudo -i

# Method 2: Non-login shell as root
sudo -s

# Method 3: Explicitly run bash as root
sudo /bin/bash

# Verify
whoami
pwd
```

**Key difference:**
- `sudo -i` = like `su -` (login shell, changes to /root)
- `sudo -s` = like `su` (keeps current directory)
