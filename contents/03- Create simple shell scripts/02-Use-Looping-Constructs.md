# Use Looping Constructs

## RHCSA Exam Objective
> Use Looping constructs (for, etc.) to process file, command line input

---

## Introduction

Loops allow you to repeat commands multiple times, which is essential for processing files, lists, and automating repetitive tasks. The RHCSA exam tests your ability to use `for`, `while`, and `until` loops effectively in shell scripts.

---

## Loop Types

| Loop | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `for` | Iterate over a list of items |
| `while` | Repeat while condition is true |
| `until` | Repeat until condition becomes true |

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Basic For Loop
**Task:** Write a script that prints numbers 1 through 5.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```

**Using brace expansion:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```
</details>

---

### Question 2: For Loop with Range and Step
**Task:** Write a script that prints even numbers from 2 to 10.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {2..10..2}; do
    echo "$i"
done
```

**Output:**
```
2
4
6
8
10
```
</details>

---

### Question 3: Loop Through Files
**Task:** Write a script that lists all `.conf` files in `/etc`.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in /etc/*.conf; do
    echo "Found config file: $file"
done
```
</details>

---

### Question 4: Loop Through Files in Directory
**Task:** Write a script that lists all files in `/var/log`.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in /var/log/*; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        echo "File: $file"
    fi
done
```
</details>

---

### Question 5: Process Each Line of a File
**Task:** Write a script that reads `/etc/hosts` line by line and prints each line.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while read line; do
    echo "$line"
done < /etc/hosts
```

**Alternative using `for` (not recommended for files with spaces):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for line in $(cat /etc/hosts); do
    echo "$line"
done
```

**Note:** The `while read` method is preferred because it handles spaces correctly.
</details>

---

### Question 6: Process File with Field Extraction
**Task:** Write a script that reads `/etc/passwd` and extracts usernames.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while IFS=: read username rest; do
    echo "User: $username"
done < /etc/passwd
```

**Extract specific fields:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

while IFS=: read username x uid gid comment home shell; do
    echo "User: $username, UID: $uid, Shell: $shell"
done < /etc/passwd
```

**Note:** `IFS=:` sets the field separator to colon for reading `/etc/passwd`.
</details>

---

### Question 7: While Loop with Counter
**Task:** Write a script that counts from 1 to 5 using a while loop.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

counter=1

while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```
</details>

---

### Question 8: Until Loop
**Task:** Write a script that uses `until` to count from 1 to 5.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

counter=1

until [ $counter -gt 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```

**Note:** `until` is the opposite of `while` - it runs until the condition becomes true.
</details>

## Loop Control Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `break` | Exit the loop immediately |
| `continue` | Skip to next iteration |
| `break n` | Exit n levels of nested loops |
| `continue n` | Skip to next iteration of nth outer loop |

---

## Quick Reference

### For Loop Patterns
```bash
# List
for i in item1 item2 item3; do ... done

# Range
for i in {1..10}; do ... done

# Range with step
for i in {0..100..10}; do ... done

# Files
for file in /path/*.ext; do ... done

# Command output
for item in $(command); do ... done

# C-style
for ((i=0; i<10; i++)); do ... done
```

### While/Until Patterns
```bash
# While condition
while [ condition ]; do ... done

# Until condition
until [ condition ]; do ... done

# Read file
while read line; do ... done < file

# Read with delimiter
while IFS=: read f1 f2; do ... done < file
```

## Summary

For the RHCSA exam, ensure you can:

1. **Use `for` loops** to iterate over lists, ranges, and files
2. **Use `while` loops** for condition-based repetition
3. **Use `until` loops** when appropriate
4. **Read files line by line** using `while read`
5. **Use `IFS`** to parse delimited data
6. **Apply `break` and `continue`** for loop control
7. **Process file patterns** with glob expressions
8. **Create practical scripts** that use loops for system tasks
