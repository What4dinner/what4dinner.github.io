# Conditionally Execute Code

## RHCSA Exam Objective
> Conditionally execute code (use of: if, test, [], etc.)

---

## Introduction

Shell scripts often need to make decisions based on conditions. The RHCSA exam tests your ability to write scripts that use conditional statements to execute different code paths based on test results. Understanding `if`, `test`, `[ ]`, and `[[ ]]` constructs is essential.

---

## Basic Syntax

### The `if` Statement

```bash
if condition; then
    commands
fi
```

### `if-else` Statement

```bash
if condition; then
    commands
else
    other_commands
fi
```

### `if-elif-else` Statement

```bash
if condition1; then
    commands1
elif condition2; then
    commands2
else
    other_commands
fi
```

## Test Commands

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `test expression` | Traditional test command |
| `[ expression ]` | Equivalent to `test` (POSIX) |
| `[[ expression ]]` | Enhanced test (Bash-specific) |

**Important:** Spaces are required after `[` and before `]`.

---

## File Test Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-e FILE` | File exists |
| `-f FILE` | File exists and is a regular file |
| `-d FILE` | File exists and is a directory |
| `-r FILE` | File is readable |
| `-w FILE` | File is writable |
| `-x FILE` | File is executable |
| `-s FILE` | File exists and has size > 0 |
| `-L FILE` | File is a symbolic link |

---

## String Test Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-z STRING` | String is empty (zero length) |
| `-n STRING` | String is not empty |
| `STRING1 = STRING2` | Strings are equal |
| `STRING1 != STRING2` | Strings are not equal |

---

## Numeric Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-eq` | Equal |
| `-ne` | Not equal |
| `-lt` | Less than |
| `-le` | Less than or equal |
| `-gt` | Greater than |
| `-ge` | Greater than or equal |

---

## Logical Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `!` | NOT (negation) |
| `-a` | AND (inside `[ ]`) |
| `-o` | OR (inside `[ ]`) |
| `&&` | AND (between commands or inside `[[ ]]`) |
| `\|\|` | OR (between commands or inside `[[ ]]`) |

    if [ $SIZE -gt $MAX_SIZE ]; then
        echo "Log file exceeds 10MB"
    else
        echo "Log file is within limits"
    fi
else
    echo "Log file does not exist"
fi
```
</details>

## Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Problem | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `[: missing ]` | No spaces around brackets | Use `[ expression ]` |
| `unary operator expected` | Empty variable | Quote variables: `"$VAR"` |
| `integer expression expected` | String in numeric comparison | Validate input is numeric |

---

## Quick Reference

### Test Command Syntax
```bash
# These are equivalent:
test -f /etc/passwd
[ -f /etc/passwd ]

# Enhanced test (Bash):
[[ -f /etc/passwd ]]
```

### Exit Status
- `0` = true/success
- Non-zero = false/failure

### Conditional Execution
```bash
# Execute if previous succeeded
command1 && command2

# Execute if previous failed
command1 || command2
```

## Summary

For the RHCSA exam, ensure you can:

1. **Use `if-then-else-fi`** statements correctly
2. **Apply file tests** (`-e`, `-f`, `-d`, `-r`, `-w`, `-x`)
3. **Compare strings** using `=` and `!=`
4. **Compare numbers** using `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-gt`, `-le`, `-ge`
5. **Combine conditions** with `-a`, `-o`, `&&`, `||`
6. **Negate conditions** with `!`
7. **Check command exit status** using `$?` or directly in `if`
8. **Use `case` statements** for multiple options
