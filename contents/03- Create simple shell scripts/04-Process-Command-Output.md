# Processing Output of Shell Commands Within a Script

## RHCSA Exam Objective
> Processing output of shell commands within a script

---

## Introduction

Shell scripts often need to capture the output of commands and use it within the script. The RHCSA exam tests your ability to use command substitution to store and process command output in variables, conditions, and loops.

---

## Command Substitution Syntax

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `$(command)` | Modern syntax (preferred) |
| `` `command` `` | Legacy syntax (backticks) |

**Note:** `$(command)` is preferred because it's easier to read and can be nested.

---

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Store Command Output in Variable
**Task:** Write a script that stores the current date in a variable.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
echo "Today's date is: $TODAY"
```

**Legacy syntax:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

TODAY=`date +%Y-%m-%d`
echo "Today's date is: $TODAY"
```
</details>

## Common Commands for Script Output

| Command | Output |
|---------|--------|
| `date` | Current date/time |
| `hostname` | System hostname |
| `whoami` | Current username |
| `pwd` | Current directory |
| `uname -r` | Kernel version |
| `uptime` | System uptime |
| `df` | Disk usage |
| `free` | Memory usage |
| `ps` | Process list |
| `id` | User/group IDs |

---

## Quick Reference

### Command Substitution
```bash
# Modern syntax (preferred)
VAR=$(command)

# Legacy syntax
VAR=`command`

# Nested substitution
VAR=$(cmd1 $(cmd2))
```

### Output Processing
```bash
# Store in variable
OUTPUT=$(command)

# Use in condition
if [ "$(command)" = "value" ]; then

# Use in loop
for item in $(command); do

# Use in filename
file_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
```

### Exit Status
```bash
command
EXIT_CODE=$?
```

## Summary

For the RHCSA exam, ensure you can:

1. **Use `$(command)`** for command substitution
2. **Store command output** in variables
3. **Use output in conditions** with `if [ "$(cmd)" ...]`
4. **Use output in loops** with `for item in $(cmd)`
5. **Create dynamic filenames** with embedded commands
6. **Combine multiple commands** in variables
7. **Process and extract** fields from command output
8. **Capture exit status** using `$?`
